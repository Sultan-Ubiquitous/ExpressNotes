SO what the hell is express and why the do we use it and why do i need to use it and why is it so confusing,
so let's start with complete basics.
In simpler terms it is used to help 2 computers communicate.
Now how do computers communicate, there is an concept known as OSI layer which basically says
that there are finalized addresses known as IP address, and then there are temporary use devices in the process of transferring the data with the MAC address
and all communication occurs with either WIFI or wires.
So to send data from one computer to other we search for IP of the computer and send it there.
Now when it comes to website or webpages or anything to the web, first we go to the address of the web and then based
on the address stuff is displayed with the help of express, if we go to another address there then the express displays another data from the server
now in databases, we can say go to database and do this, this is what exactly express does, it goes there and does something.
express means go there and do something.
